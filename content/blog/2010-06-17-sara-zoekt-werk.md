Half may [Sara Van de Velde][2] quit her job at Queromedia as a SEA consultant, because she felt she was not at the right track in her career. During her search for a new job she discovered that her resume gets put in the pile of other applicants for that same job.

To stand out from the crowd she created an online campaign, through the website <a href="http://www.sarazoektwerk.be/" rel="friend met muse" title="Sara zoekt werkt">Sara zoekt werk (in dutch)</a> she is blogging about her search for work. Not only does she blog about her own jobhunt, she also shares tips and tricks on what works when you are looking for a job.
