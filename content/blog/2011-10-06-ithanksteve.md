This image on the homepage of [Apple.com][1]says it all.

If you look at name apple gave the image, it gives you a very clear hint at how they see their founder. A hero, he was and still is one of my personal heroes.

But I will not mourn, I will honor his life as he did himself. Watch his commencement speech: &#8220;How to live before you die&#8221;
