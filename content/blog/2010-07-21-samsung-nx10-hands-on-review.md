Last month I had the opportunity to play with the Samsung NX10 camera. As said in [my previous post][1] I really liked the camera and that didn&#8217;t change during the 10 days I was allowed to use it. I even wanted to keep the camera with the 20mm pancake lens. Just because it is such an amazing small and convenient camera, it can go anywhere with you and it delivers great results.

I used the NX10 to shoot some behind the scene material during a wedding with [Bert Stephani][2]. The photos are taken with the 20mm pancake lens and as jpeg in monochrome mode. The results are very good and I like the speed, the sharpness and the fast focus it has.

I also tried the NX10 during the &#8220;dijlefeesten&#8221; festival in my hometown and during some other low light conditions. The results are quite exceptional, the noise is very acceptable, that&#8217;s mainly because of the large sensor, it&#8217;s actually only a 1.5 crop factor. But not only the noise is very acceptable, the autofocus is also very good and fast even with the lights on stage flooding the frame.

I can keep on talking about the technical stuff of this camera. Samsung had to make some compromises to keep the camera small but the experience with this camera is just great, I mean it just awesome to use, it&#8217;s small, fast, easy to use, but most of all it&#8217;s fun to use. Samsung keep up the good work.
