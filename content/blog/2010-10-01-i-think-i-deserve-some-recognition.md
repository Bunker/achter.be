This is a quote from &#8220;The Social Network&#8221;, the movie I was invited to watch yesterday in a screening together with some other bloggers.

&#8220;The social network&#8221; is the film about Marc Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook.com, a site I and probably you use every day. That for starters makes it very weird to watch the movie. I knew a bit about how the story of facebook goes and have to say, it stays very close to what happened in real life.

I&#8217;m not that big of a film geek, that I know what the director made before and what the main actors are known for, but I can appreciate a good movie and have some attention for how the film is filmed. The first thing I noticed is a very distinctive style of filming and the great use of subtle light. That makes a movie already more interesting for me. Also the fact that I&#8217;m a geek, helps when the movie is about a geek creating the biggest social network.

The movie was very fastpaced and has two law suits from in the first years of facebook nicely intertwined with the story of how facebook grew from an idea to having 1 billion members. At moments it is a bit too fast to follow, so you&#8217;ll probably miss a lot of subtle humour. But at other moments the story seemed to drag along, with the biggest anticlimax the launch of thefacebook.com. Just a press on a button and that was it, not even a beer was cracked at that moment. A bit pity but if that&#8217;s the way it went, although just for the film&#8217;s sake I would have put it in, anyway.

Although 2 hours is already pretty long for a movie, I found it disappointing that the biggest move facebook ever made, was not included in the film. I mean the film stopped at moving over to the UK universities and reaching there 1 billion members. I would have loved to see how it all grew and why they made the brightest and biggest move facebook could ever make, which was giving up being exclusive and going open to everybody, so that you and I now can be on facebook too.

I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the feeling that I have after seeing the movie. I liked it, I liked it a lot. However, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a movie that will be a big hit, because of the niche of people that it will appeal to. I will definitely see it again, when it comes on tv or on dvd, if not only to figure out the feeling I&#8217;m left with.

Enjoy the trailer and thx <a href="http://www.adhese.com" rel="contact met" title="adhese.com">Adhese</a> for inviting me.
