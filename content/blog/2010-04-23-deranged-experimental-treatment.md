On the evening of Easter I found myself with some spare time. An idea started to form in my head, just for fun I wanted to recreate a movie poster. After a <a href="http://twitter.com/Bunker/status/11601861573" rel="me" title="Bunker at twitter">tweet</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">@DeFre</a> became my instant model.

This left me just one hour to find a poster I wanted, think about how I would achieve the same look and prepare everything. I found this movie poster:
  
![Movie Poster for Crank 2 High Voltage][1]
  
because I knew <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">Fré</a> already, I was pretty sure it would work.

After some tweaking in post processing and the addition of artificial smoke, because I couldn&#8217;t gather enough smokers on a short notice, here is the result

The shoot was done in a total of 4 hours from idea till final image. I used 2 bowens gemini 500R studiolights with a bowens travelpak. The photo was taken in 20sec exposure while manually triggering the flashes 3 times.

I&#8217;m not completely satisfied with the result but it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;ve learned a lot while doing this and most importantly we all had a lot of fun. Big thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">Fré</a> to go along with my crazy idea and <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" rel="sweetheart co-resident friend" title="Sara Van de Velde">Sara</a> for helping out, withstanding the cold and being the beer supplier of the evening.
