Last year when <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="Saravdv, there are no endings only new beginnings" rel="muse met">Saravdv</a> and I went to Paris for the iPad launch at the louvre Apple store, we were asked if we could be filmed for a possible promo film for Apple. As we got some iTunes gift cards in exchange, we did agree.

Since then we did not hear anything about it anymore, until last night when I watched the keynote, to my surprise I could see sara and myself during the video of &#8220;2010: the year of the iPad.&#8221; as I&#8217;m a very big applefanboy, I&#8217;m quite proud to be in the video that his Steveness showed during a keynote. If you want to check it out, watch the keynote at [Apple event website][2]. You can see us very briefly at 9:49 min in the keynote.

Update, you can also watch the video of &#8220;iPad: Year One&#8221; on Apple&#8217;s YouTube channel. I have embedded the video also here, you can see Sara and me at 0:35min.
