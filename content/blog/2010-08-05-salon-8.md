At the beginning of july I got asked by <a href="http://www.wonderingmick.com/" title="MICK!" rel="contact, met">Mick</a> to join <a href="http://salon8.cktail.com/" title="Salon8" rel="contact, met, muse">Salon 8</a>. Salon 8 is a project where 8 photographers take on 26 themes. Now because they started in January, but somebody quit, they had an open spot, where I could fit in.

I already knew the project, had followed it on the website, so I did not think very long and agreed to take part. My first assignment was already 4 days later, but I managed to photograph and upload in time.

The reason I said yes, is because it is perfect to try out some new ideas and to start with a theme and make a picture around it. Anyway these are my first 3 entries.
