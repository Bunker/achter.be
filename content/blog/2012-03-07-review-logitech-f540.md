Playing the xbox late at night, while my girlfriend is asleep, isn't possible. So I asked Logitech if I could test out the Logitech F540 wireless headphones for game consoles.

A few days later I had the headphones. After unpacking the rather neatly put together box, it was very easy hooking it up to the Xbox. You basically plugg 2 wires into the basestation. The power and the audio cable. It couldn't be easier

After turning on the headphones and pushing the sync button on both the station and the headphones, all was set. I played several hours while wearing the headset and was very pleased with the battery life, about 10 play hours. The sound quality for me was great too, although I'm not really a sound guy, but heck it was decent enough to hear the rain fall in Oblivion which for me is all I need.

I didn't really use the microphone in game, but it's pleasing to hear yourself through the headphones when the mic is on, so you don't scream when talking. I did try it once and it seemed to work decent enough, but I can't really tell because none of the other players in the game bothered to talk.

Most headphones are quite hard to wear after a while, because my ear gets pinched, but the F540 has cups that go all around your ear, not on your ear which is very nice.

The only big problem I had and what for me is kinda of a deal breaker, is that fact that I got loads of interference after a while. Especially when the Xbox was online over the wifi signal, I tried all solutions found on the web, but none really helped, except putting the transmitter at a 45 degrees angle, but that is not very handy when you need somebody to hold the transmitter while you are playing.

So overall, I like the headset a lot, but there are 2 things I didn't like, one is that I couldn't use digital audio on it, which is very annoying because our tv only has a headphones and digital out connection and the headphones is never surround and the second one was the interference I got from other devices.
