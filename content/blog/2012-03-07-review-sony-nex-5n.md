Sony is really good at letting me test their new cameras. A little while ago I had the chance to test the Sony nex-5n, the successor of the nex-5. I had the pleasure of photographing with the nex-5, which I reviewed over <a href="http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/" title="Sony Nex-5, hands-on Review" rel="me">here</a>. As I said then, I didn&#8217;t like the menus, the startup time, &#8230;

The 5n is a whole different deal, in fact it&#8217;s a great camera. Sony really listened to their users, they did a real good job cleaning up the menu-interface. It feels snappy, intuitive and very logical.

The quality of the photos is great, it can match the quality of my 5d MK II, which is about 1500 euro more expensive. The photo above is a shot of a concert at 3200 iso, with the standard jpg b/w conversion on it. There is almost no noise and the image is pretty sharp.

My other concern about the nex-5 was the that the camera was pretty slow, well the 5n is definitely not slow. It has a fast autofocus, pretty short start up time, but when you can capture a race-car in full focus on a track, I can only say that it&#8217;s really fast.

But as with every camera, there are a couple of drawbacks, the first being that you don&#8217;t have a viewfinder, that&#8217;s pretty annoying when photographing in bright light. Sony kinda solved this problem by adding a swiveling screen, a very sturdy one I have to say.

Then there is the fact that the flash is external, an sich not a real problem, except sony doens&#8217;t like standard hotshoes. They didn&#8217;t even include the typical sony hotshoe, so the only way you can use a flash is by using the included small flash, a flash I don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s small, there are almost no way to control it and it feels pretty filmsy.

The most annoying thing, but that&#8217;s something I have found in all Sony cameras is the way, you can review your photos and videos on it. I can imagine some people find it very good, but I don&#8217;t want to go through the menu to view everything I have on my card.

Despite the few things I didn&#8217;t like that much, the nex-5n is a very decent camera. Even so good that my girlfriend and I are actually considering buying one, how&#8217;s that for a reference. I test a lot of mirrorless cameras and this is the first I really think is up to par with all DSLR&#8217;s in the same or even a bit higher price range.

_Thx to my girlfriend <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="There are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="contact, friend">Saravdv</a> for taking most of the pictures._
