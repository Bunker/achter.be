This blog is a reincarnation of my old blog, the purpose is to post everything that's too long to tweet and everything I’m not able to post at PitsLamp. This will include behind the scenes footage of PitsLamp, personal stuff of me, reviews, stuff I’m working on, tutorials, … </p?

Just enjoy what you see and read
