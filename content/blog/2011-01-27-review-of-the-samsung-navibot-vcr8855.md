After more than 2 months using the Navibot, I want to give you a review. Let me say, we're pretty pleased with the Robot vacuum cleaner.

Although it's not a total solution for cleaning, it does a very good job keeping the house clean, when you set it on a daily routine. It takes a structured path, which takes it through the most part of the room. During it's path, it tries to cover the whole area, but misses some spots. Luckily it doesn't take the same path everyday and does the missed spots the next day.

Once a week we empty the container containing the dust and hairs,. So it doesn't require a lot of maintanance but whenever you forget about putting away all toys for the cat or the floorcloths, we use as doormats, something is bound to get stuck in the rotating brushes. Then the robot stops and starts beeping, until you fix the problem, that's annoying and drives our cat crazy when we aren't at home. But apart from that, it doesn't get trapped under furniture, it doesn't wrecks anything around the home. It only bumps into the furniture that has legs that are smaller than 5cm because it is in the blind spot of the sensors. Even when it does bump into your furniture, it doesn't really damages it, because of the rubber bumpers.

The only very annoying thing about the robot is whenever you use the guards, it gets confused because the beam of the guard spreads wider then you intend and that leaves areas around the guard without cleaning. Our robot also had a little defect, which broke the system that makes the back brush rotate and we had to send it in for repair. Since then it drives around and cleans the whole area very good.

If you are looking for a decent robot vacuum cleaner, then this is definitely what you need. It does a really good job keeping the house clean, without you lifting a finger, it's definitely not perfect but it's a great aid. For us it is a great tool and definitely cheaper than paying a cleaning lady. So yes, it's an expensive buy, but it will pay off after a while, because maintenance is not expensive at all. Even after 2 months we didn't have to change any of the brushes.
