Yesterday I did some live blogging during the presentation, but last night and today I had some time to think about the evening and all the stuff we've seen. My initial thoughts are, the organisation could have been a bit better. Although the venue was very fine, the little food I got my hands on was good and the goodie bags were awesome.

The presentations could have been less confusing and the quiz afterwards should have been organized better. It was a very nice way of letting us vote, but apparently some of the remotes didn't work, which off course manipulated the results quite a bit. Not that I was harmed by that, I just don't know enough info about movies. Very important I think there should have been a round for questions after every presentation, because a lot of people had questions about the TV's that could have been interesting for all of us.

But on the 3D itself now. I'm still not convinced about the whole concept of 3D. I don't really like watching a movie in 3D, first of all, it still feels very unreal. The biggest drawback is that in order to experience 3D TV, you still need to wear a pair of glasses, who are btw very expensive. 

Imagine following situation: you're coming home after a day of work, you eat something, decide to watch some relaxing television, but wait&#8230;, where did I leave the glasses, I mean I'm already having trouble locating the remote control of the TV. Let's say I found them, apparently our cat decided that the glasses were to play with and has left some scratches and bite marks all over it. Well, still not really a problem, let's just try them on, oh wait, they are not charged anymore, because i forgot to put them in the USB charger. By now my relax evening of watching TV has been ruined already. So I decide to ditch the glasses, turn off the TV and get behind the computer to get some more work done. Great

This is fictional, for the moment, but at a certain point this could turn into reality. I don't want that kind of reality. Give me a 2D screen, which I turn on, look for the remote for about a minute and further on I can watch the 50th rerun of &#8220;Allo, Allo&#8221; or something. I find it a pretty stupid concept to try to mimic 3D in film or a serie, because you can't interact with the world that's living around you. So in that perspective I think gaming in 3D has a future, yesterday I played a bit with avatar in 3D and I very much liked it. Because you are in the 3D environment you can better experience the game and interact with it. Although I still think that for a game to be using 3D to the fullest you really need to be in the middle of the game terrain, like it was promised with Virtual Reality.

All in all I had a fun evening, met some nice people, saw the regular crowd again and as usual shot some photos (find more in this [set][4]). But I don't think anyone of the people at the event will buy a television that starts at 1800 euro with only 2 glasses and without a lot of quality content.
