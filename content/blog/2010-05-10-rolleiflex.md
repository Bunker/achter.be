Photographing with the vredebox made me realize that I wanted to experience more of analog photography. So I started searching online for a more advanced camera. The vredebox is great, but you're so limited to what you can photograph with it and how. So I wanted so more control over depth of field, shutterspeed and aperture. My search let me towards the Twin Lens Reflex camera's. Although these camera's are pretty old, you still pay a good amount of money for them. I mean a mamiya or yashica changes owner for about 300 euro on ebay.

On <a href="hhttp://www.2dehands.be/foto-camera/" title="Foto en camera op 2dehands.be" rel="none">2dehands.be</a> I found after a lot of searching a original Rolleiflex Standard 622 from 1934 for 50 euro. I went to check it out, although it misses the plate with the serial number, everything else is in great shape. I went with it.

The Rolleiflex original standard model was made by Franke & Heidecke in Braunschweig, Germany from 1932 to 1938. The lens is a 75mm f3.5 uncoated carl zeis lens, the shutter goes from 1/500 till 1 second. And off course there is a bulb mode. Apparently famous war photographer and Magnum co-founder Robert Capa used this camera during WW II, next to a contax camera.

I tried some different film with it, at the moment I haven't figured out which one I prefer but what I do know is, that this is an awsome camera. Just look at some of the results.
