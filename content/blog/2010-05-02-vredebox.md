When my grandparents died last year, my family and I had to clean out their house. I knew they had a very old camera on their chimney but I didn&#8217;t know if it still worked. To my big surprise everything worked great, although it all could use a little cleaning. 

I started researching the camera on the internet and found that it&#8217;s a vredebox made by a German company called vredeborch in Friedeburg. The camera uses 120 film, has a meniscus lens with an aperture of f11. Fastest shutterspeed is 1/30th of a second. There are 3 levers on the side, one for stopping down the lens to f16 and the other 2 to use the bulb setting.

Those settings are a bit of a let down, but I wanted to test it out anyway. So after <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend met" title="Pieter Van Impe">Pieter</a> gave me a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 pro, I started shooting with the vredebox.

Oh yeah, just so you know, the minimum focus distance on this camera is 3 meters.

Let me first post some results and then I&#8217;ll give a little review about the camera.

If you want to follow my progress with the vredebox, I suggest you follow this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157623847114053/" rel="me" title="[Film] Vredebox on flickr.com">set on flickr</a>, I&#8217;ll post the results there when available.

Now for a short review of the camera. Although it&#8217;s technically not very good, I really like the box feeling and the way of taking pictures. Because of the lack of features or wide range of aperture and shutterspeed, I think a lot more before I make I picture. This makes that I&#8217;m more concentrating on the framing of the shot, which is not easy in the small viewfinder located at your stomach.

Until now I&#8217;m very pleased with the results of the box, a camera that&#8217;s at least 60 year old. It&#8217;s a decent and fun camera for hobby projects, so I&#8217;ll be playing with it a lot more in the future
