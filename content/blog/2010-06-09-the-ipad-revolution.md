Today I&#8217;ve used my iPad for 12 days and I love it even more then I did the first day.

I love catching up with my RSS feeds, reading and replying to e-mails, writing blogposts and booking a hotel. The size of the screen makes it a great device for presenting pictures and watching series or movies streamed from my MBP.

Typing on the ipad is actually pretty good, you can&#8217;t use your regular typing position but typing with 6 fingers works very well. It&#8217;s just an awesome device to use all the time and everywhere.

But there are a few small things that annoy me. First of all Apple should have included some way to prop up the iPad when resting it in your lap or putting it on the table to type with 2 hands. Now I&#8217;m always looking for a way to elevate it a bit and most of the time I&#8217;m putting my wallet under it, because that&#8217;s the perfect height and doesn&#8217;t slip. But at the moment I did not find any great case yet. I would love the [DODO case][1] but they are backordered for 4 to 6 weeks and they are missing a nice height for watching movies

Another annoying thing is that at the moment there is no Twitter client that I like and definitely no app that satisfies my needs for google reader, but off course there&#8217;s an app for that at least over time there will.

But the most annoying thing is taking it out of your bag in Belgium. once you take it out to usef it, there&#8217;s always somebody who starts saying that there are better things to use, you can&#8217;t do this or that,&#8230; Basically I like my iPad, it serves the purpose where I bought it for, so just let me use it and don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m taking it out to brag, I just want to use it.

Now I&#8217;m going to stop this blogpost so I can watch [chase jarvis live][2]
